# Exercise our legal rights, call for a full investigation

**BOTH affected members of the community and others who are watching this massive financial crime happen, watching it actively hurting innocent people and tarnishing the reputation of all cryptocurrencies** request an official investigation from our legal systems.

### Who to report them to?
1. Switzerland Fedpol who handles corruption with non-profits
1. Switzerland Financial authorities that Bity SA is are registered with
2. Local authorities who will contact and work with Swiss authorities

**Switzerland will investigate**

Switzerland is in the middle of a policy shift regarding financial crimes, while it was once considered a safe haven for financial crime, they are now actively taking action to crack down and they actively cooperate with legal international investigations so it is worth reporting to local investigations too.

##Format for Petition to Intervene by Electronic Copy (Email)

##### To: Pamela.Monroe@sec.nh.gov

Subject: Petition to Intervene & Investigate

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

Re: Ethereum Foundation, Slock.it GBMH, and Bity SA Petition to Intervene

To Whom May Concern: 

[I/We] respectfully request to investigate and preferably intervene in the
illegal seizure of 7,000,000 original Ether by Ethereum Foundation, Slock.it 
GBMH, and Bity SA. Who tried to coordinate a sell of the illegally obtained
original Ether to coordinate crashing the price of the original Ethereum 
to convince users to adopt their new version of Ethereum that has features
to enable the Ethereum Foundation to change any past transaction, stop
smart contracts,  allow third parties to replace the code of a smart contract.

Due to gross negligence of Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit promoting and
trading a security created on their cryptocurrency Ethereum called DAO,
collaborating with the swiss SA Bity and the German company Slock.it created
a security contract and sold according to wikipedia 160,000,000 USD worth of the
newly created security for the cryptocurrency Ether.

Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest_funded_crowdfunding_projects

After being informed by security researchers a bug in the contract had been found
both Bity SA and Slock.it continued to promote the security, ignoring the risk.

If you look at the forum.daohub.org community you can clearly see, they see it as 
a security threads like "Is profit from DAO investment unlikely?"

The contract they created can be found here: https://daohub.org

Source: https://forum.daohub.org/t/is-profit-from-dao-investment-unlikely/1466
Source: https://blog.slock.it/no-dao-funds-at-risk-following-the-ethereum-smart-contract-recursive-call-bug-discovery-29f482d348b#.4geeq3dny

Statistical analysis was done on purchasers of the DAO security, using blockchain
data. 

It was determined "The wealthy few (top 1% of addresses) control over 55% of the 
voting power of proposals, while everyone who contributed 100 Ether or less (more than 66%) 
control barely over 2% of the total tokens."

Source: https://medium.com/the-bitcoin-podcast-blog/looking-at-the-dao-address-distribution-part-1-f324e71381bf#.ivoddhx3y

After the exploit was reported and disregarded by the operators an anonymous entity
used the exploit to steal 1/3rd of the cryptocurrency that was used to buy the security.
Worth est. 50,000,000 USD worth of Ether at the time.

After the exploit was used, Vitalik Buterin, the leader of the Ethereum Foundation,
trying to encourage buying said "@junseth I will provide my opinion in the way that 
@Truthcoin would approve of: I have been buying DAO tokens since the security news"
Source: https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/741832934814949377

Anyone with knowledge in finance would immediately ask, why is the leader of a project
that just had 50 million dollars worth of securities stolen, continue to buy those
securities? The answer is because Vitalik Buterin had not yet announced it, but had
already unilaterally decided that they would be creating a hard fork, essentially
creating a new version of the Ether cryptocurrency and modifying the contract to 
stop it, and replace it with different code. The original Ether would still exist,
but they would start a new one alongside it.

Invalidating the claim on their website that Ethereum:

"Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that 
run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or 
third party interference."

Source: https://ethereum.org/

Despite pretending this decision was made by the community, the entire decision process
was centralized to the Ethereum Foundation internal private chats.

Later it would come out with chat logs between the exchange operators after the event and 
even more later in pull requests from the Foundation that internal chats had decided the 
entire thing long before it was announced. So when Vitalik Buterin was buying DAO tokens, 
he had already known he would soft or hard, regardless of the stakeholders. Chat log between 
Ethereum Foundation and Exchange Operators

You can validate the authenticity of this chat log easily by talking to the exchange operators,
they operate: http://kraken.com , http://poloniex.com, http://bitfinex.com http://yubi.com

Source: http://pastebin.com/raw/aMKwQcHR

Comments on code published clearly state that decision to implement the hard fork in the client 
used by roughly 95%+ would be defaulting to the option that benefited them the most financially.
The deciding factor it would be implemented because the majority of users do not even know how 
to change the setting.

"default behavior of Geth to be pro-fork as per internal discussions"
Source: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/2814

While they implemented this they started a back up plan where the Ethereum
Foundation, Slock.it GBMH and Bity SA worked anonymously as a hacking 
group named "The White Hat Group" or "Robin Hood Group" (WHG or RHG). They
captured 2/3rd of the Ether that was in the DAO security using the same 
exploit the original exploiter did.

This plays a very important part later but because there was a fork, advertising
efforts were made to brand the new copy of Ethereum with changes to one contract
as the real Ether while many people continued to use the same Ether The Ethereum
Foundation had sold them in the crowdsale.

The speculated reason for breaking their system, creating an entire new one is due the 
massive loss taken by the 1% of DAO owners.

The Ethereum Foundation actively promoted the DAO security on their blog, the
inventors of Ethereum both Gavin Wood and Vitalik Buterin  became "curators", 
claiming they would check every contract for errors making sure the DAO was
secure.The Ethereum Foundation having pitched sales of the DAO to wealthy 
investors from the financial sector had to answer to them when the contract
they were supposed to check, failed. Knowing they would lose all their 
instituational investment from the Financial industry they created a new 
Ethereum that was fundamentally different than Ethereum.

Some people in the Ethereum community began to call this new version Ethereum
hard fork, or ETF. This new ETF Ethereum had features that allowed the developers
to change old transactions, stop applications, and allowed third parties (them) 
to arbitrary change out the code in a contract. 

This made ETF distinctly different than the Ethereum that much of the community
continued using that they originally received directly from the Ethereum Foundation
during the crowdsale. It did not match any of the advertising about unstoppable 
applications, but the original Ethereum didn't have all these new features
that changed it into essentially the opposite of the description of Ethereum. So
people wanting unstoppable applications, with no third party interference and
censorship resistence just kept using Ethereum, trading it and building with it.

Then the Ethereum Foundation, Slock.it GMBH and Bity SA used the exploit used
by the hacker that led to the hard fork to get control of the 7,000,000 Ether
they wrestled from the hacker before the fork. Without telling anyone
they begin to launder the money. They did this by splitting the amount into
smaller amounts and sending it to random addresses they created before sending 
it to the markets.

But because it was done poorly it was quickly determined where it was going, to
currency exchanges to be sold.

Before some exchanges managed to freeze their accounts, they had successfully sold 
off large amounts of the stolen ETH to buy a new asset/security that was recently
created, which they hold significant portion of total security/token. 

Source: http://i.imgur.com/CBRclaF.jpg

The "White Hat Group" moved large amounts of the original Ether to exchanges and
coordinated a mass sell trying to crash the price. The goal was to crash the price
and convince people still using the original Ethereum that they had no choice. 

Leaked Skype chat logs from the private Ethereum Foundation internal chat were leaked
showing they were in fact colluding to control the price and force the community to follow the
decision they unilaterly made. If all the chat logs could be obtained from Skype
it would be very clear to what extent the collusion and illegal usage of the Ethereum
Foundation. 

In the private chat of the supposedly non-profit 
Ethereum Foudnation Skype channel, they are seen colluding control the price of the 
competing original Ethereum.

Chat logs from leaked Ethereum Foundation chat log indicating they were colluding to 
control the price of competing the original Ethereum.

In the chat logs, Jeffrey Wilcke and Fabian Vogelsteller can both be seen discussing 
ways to use the resources of the non-profit Ethereum Foundation to control the price 
of the original Ethereum and the new Ethereum. Owning significant amounts of the new
Ethereum.

This is not an isolated incident of Ethereum Foundation using their insider knowledge
from operating the non-profit to make purchasing decisions. Vitalik Buterin of 
the Ethereum Foundation, shortly after the hack but before he announced there 
would be a hard fork announced he was buying DAO security/tokens on Twitter.

This is the exact opposite of decentralized governance, depsite operating as a Swiss 
non-profit with money raised by the community crowd sale for the "mission to promote
and support research, development and education to bring decentralized protocols". 

Source: http://ethereum.org

There are likely more crimes actively happening but we only know of this because the
 currency exchange operators froze some of the "White Hat Group" accounts due to 
suspicious activity. This forced the "White Hat Group" to reveal themselves. It would
 be best to talk to Kraken.com and Poloneix.com, both exchanges who froze assets of 
the "White Hat Group" members after their attempts to launder and sell the cryptocurrency.

Ursium on reddit is Slock.it COO Stephan Tual creator of "The DAO" security, who originally 
designed with the intention to fund his businesses including Slock.it. Clearly named Ethereum 
Foundation devs as the first people on the list of the "White Hat Group" and included his  
own company Slock.it. Notice the ordering, the Ethereum Foundation is the first one listed
when talking about the "White Hat Group".

"Bit more info: this isn't spur of the moment. A lot of people have worked around the clock 
for several days now to prepare for this. The community (individuals from the eth foundation, 
devs, security experts, ethcore, slock, etc) all came together to organize a response, which 
is currently ongoing."

Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDao/comments/4p60ie/we_are_doing_a_white_hat_attack_more_news_to/

Alex Van De Sande, or avsa on reddit and twitter, of the Swiss non-profit The Ethereum foundation 
is now denying any responsibility, or association, likely because of the legal fallout of recent 
events. But Alex was clearly involved with organizing the white hat group clearly was involved 
with organizing.

He was seen organizing on reddit.com/r/ethereum as seen in the screen shot below.

Source: https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*bY93URPw8UvehJXPcP2Qtg.jpeg

And more reddit posts with the titles "We are doing a white hat attack on the DAO." by avsa.

Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4p5zk9/we_are_doing_a_white_hat_attack_on_the_dao/

Alex of the Swiss non-profit the Ethereum foundation even goes further on reddit, tell people 
specifically to not to sell the DAO security they had previously promoted heavily on the Ethereum 
Foundation blog. Stating is actively being hacked by them. We here could mean presumably the 
"White Hat Group" or the Ethereum Foundation.

"We are doing a white hat attack. More news to follow. Do not panic. Do not sell."

https://np.reddit.com/r/TheDao/comments/4p60ie/we_are_doing_a_white_hat_attack_more_news_to/

He was seen organizing on twitter.com, claiming it was "our white hat counter attack", presumably 
he means the "White Hat Group" but the Ethereum Foundation. And from twitter he stated during the 
first use of the exploit by the "White Hat Group", clearly having insider knowledge by being in
the internal private Ethereum Foundation chat.

"alex van de sande ‏@avsa Jun 21 DAO IS BEING SECURELY DRAINED. DO NOT PANIC."

"alex van de sande ‏@avsa Jun 21 I repeat. There was an attack on the DAO so we launched 
**our** white hat counter attack. More updates will follow" (Emphasis is mine on 'our')

What is clear by all this that the recent claims that Alex Van De Sande has nothing to do with the
"White Hat Group" is an obviously lie.

While there is no evidence he was active participant in the laundering or selling of the original
Ether cryptocurrency for the new version in collaboration Bity SA is not clear.

What is claer, is there is evidence from a leaked Ethereum Foundation skype chat that they were actively t
rying to manipulate the price of the original Ethereum cryptocurrency to force investors to buy the new
Ethereum they promoted. This original Ethereum cryptocurrency never stopped being used by its community,
even if the Ethereum Foundation actively tried to manipulate pulbic opinion.  The exact same cryptocurrency
they told exchanges was worthless, was being traded for almost 2 USD per coin. This was also the exact same
cryptocurrency they worked with Bity SA and Slock.it GMBH to steal millions of USD worth and dump on the market.

The primary purpose of the blockchain which cryptocurrencies are built on is to prevent modificaiton of past 
transactions to prevent double spending. The Ethereum Foundation added the ability to modify past transactions, 
to stop applications and allow third party interference so they could replace the DAO code. In doing that they
no longer were working on Ethereum, and Ethereum never stopped being used or valued even if they did not want
it to. They got upset and then commited theft, fraud to manipulate the markets and force their centralized 
unilateral decision on the whole community.

The Ethereum Foundation lied to exchanges, telling them no one is still using the original Ethereum network, 
despite massive arguments in the Ethereum forum ongoing for a month, where many people said they wanted to 
'stay on the original Ethereum. One person even wrote a manifesto, convincing others that staying is the 
only way for Ethereum, the one they were advertised and bought in the crowd sale, could continue existing.

Please start an investigation, please stop these three organizations from operating a corrupt system where
they take no risks, because they can rewrite history, where they get to decide for everyone which one is
"real" even if others are actively using, trading and programming the original Ethereum all along.

Using an exploit to illegally seize the securities they created on the cryptocurrency Ethereum is theft.

We are sending this request to you, with copies to the SEC’s distribution list for this proceeding as noted
in the “cc” below.

[My/Our] particular rights, duties, privileges, immunities or other substantial interests that may be
affected if the SEC does not act immediately, start an investigation and work with Swiss Federal Police.

Swiss Federal office of police actively encourages people to report corruption. They have built a special
hotline, corruption they want reported includes:

"non-profit organisations (such as associations or foundations) in order to gain an unjustifiable material
or immaterial advantage."

Report to Swiss Federal Police https://fedpol.integrityplatform.org/index.php?action=reportIncident&type=report

Evidence that Ethereum has been abusing their non-profit for unjustifiable advantage is more than clear, as they
commit massive crimes hoping the system is too complex for them to ever be investigated.

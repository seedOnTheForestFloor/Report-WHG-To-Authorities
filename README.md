## Exercise our legal rights, call for a full investigation

**BOTH affected members of the community and others who are watching this massive financial crime happen, watching it actively hurting innocent people and tarnishing the reputation of all cryptocurrencies** request an official investigation from our legal systems.

### Who to report them to?
1. Switzerland Fedpol who handles corruption with non-profits
1. Switzerland Financial authorities that Bity SA is are registered with
2. Local authorities who will contact and work with Swiss authorities

**Switzerland will investigate**

Switzerland is in the middle of a policy shift regarding financial crimes, while it was once considered a safe haven for financial crime, they are now actively taking action to crack down and they actively cooperate with legal international investigations so it is worth reporting to local investigations too.

Evidence that Ethereum has been abusing their non-profit to protect DAO assets, using Ethereum resources to promote the DAO, ignoring their mission of decentralization when unilaterally deciding to hard-fork, using the knowledge they will hard fork to trade on insider knowledge and colluding to lower the market value of other cryptocurrencies.

    Hello,

    I would like to report an active financial crime involving a Swiss SA Bity. Bity SA, possibly in cooperation with others operated under the group names "White Hat Group" or "Robin Hood Group", are responsible for the theft and are currently still largely in possession of ~7,000,000 ether, worth est. between 50-100  million USD.

    **Summary of the known criminal activity**
    The cryptocurrency they are in possession of was obtained by exploiting bug in a digital contract that Bity SA actively promoted.

    In possession the stolen Ether, they attempted to launder it, by breaking it up and sending it to several addresses to hide the source of the money, but because it was done poorly it was quickly determined where it was going, to currency exchanges to be sold.

    Before some exchanges managed to freeze their accounts, they had successfully sold off large amounts of the stolen ETH to buy a new asset/security that was recently created, which they hold significant portion of total security/token. 
    Source: http://i.imgur.com/CBRclaF.jpg

    There are likely more crimes actively happening but we only know of this because they currency exchange operators froze some of their accounts due to suspicious activity. This forced the thieves to reveal themselves. It would be best to talk to Kraken.com and Poloneix.com, both exchanges who froze assets of the "White Hat Group" members after their attempts to launder and sell the cryptocurrency.

    The crime is being actively perpetrated by the Swiss SA Bity formerly named SBEX, co-founded by Alexis Roussel and Gian Bochsler. 

    Bity SA was authorized by FINMA conduct business with cryptocurrency.

Being a financial expert, who operated a financial currency exchange, Alexis Roussel without a doubt doubt knew the consequences of coordinating a massive sell of cryptocurrency across several markets. He was deliberately trying to to crash the price of the cryptocurrency he stole in favor for the cryptocurrency he supports.

After being caught selling the stolen cryptocurrency, and having his identity revealed by exchanges Alexis was forced to distribute the cryptocurrency to the owners they used overly complex software, even after being advised not to by many open source developers who even provided simple alternatives, resulting in a bug that forces people to donate money to Bity SA to recover their stolen cryptocurrency.

Only some of the details of the theft, laundering and subsequent fraud are known because of the failed money laundering attempts that led to their accounts being frozen when trying to liquidate the cryptocurrency for the one they hold more value in. The exact details are not known because the most decisions are decided participants in private back channels, most likely occurring on Skype and Slack channels. 

    Along with the clear evidence of involvement from Swiss SA Bity, there appears to be evidence involvement from both the German GMBH Slock.it, and Swiss non-profit Stiftung Ethereum.

        *Likley involvement from separate Swiss non-profit and German GMBH**
        Along with the clear evidence of involvement from Swiss SA Bity, there appears to be evidence involvement from both the German GMBH Slock.it, and Swiss non-profit (Stiftung Ethereum). The "White Hat Group" or "Robin Hood Group" that orchestrated to use the exploit to supposedly safe guard the money was originally organized by Alex Van De Sande of the Ethereum Foundation (Stiftung Ethereum). The reported members were from Bity SA, Slock.it GMBH and The Ethereum Foundation. 
    
    Ursium on reddit is Slock.it COO Stephan Tual creator of "The DAO" security, who originally designed with the intention to fund his businesses including Slock.it. Clearly named Ethereum Foundation devs as the first people on the list of the "White Hat Group" and included his own company Slock.it.

    "Bit more info: this isn't spur of the moment. A lot of people have worked around the clock for several days now to prepare for this. The community (individuals from the eth foundation, devs, security experts, ethcore, slock, etc) all came together to organize a response, which is currently ongoing."

But Alex was clearly involved with organizing the white hat group clearly was involved with organizing.

    Alex of the Swiss non-profit the Ethereum foundation even goes further on reddit, tell people specifically to not to sell the security/investment they have been advertising using the Ethereum Foundation blog. Stating is actively being hacked by them. We here could mean presumably the "White Hat Group" or the Ethereum Foundation.
    "We are doing a white hat attack. More news to follow. Do not panic. Do not sell."
    https://np.reddit.com/r/TheDao/comments/4p60ie/we_are_doing_a_white_hat_attack_more_news_to/

    He was seen organizing on twitter.com, claiming it was "our white hat counter attack", presumably he means the "White Hat Group" but the Ethereum Foundation. 
    And from twitter he stated during the first use of the exploit by the "White Hat Group" 
    "alex van de sande ‏@avsa Jun 21 DAO IS BEING SECURELY DRAINED. DO NOT PANIC."
    "alex van de sande ‏@avsa Jun 21 I repeat. There was an attack on the DAO so we launched **our** white hat counter attack. More updates will follow" (Emphasis is mine on 'our')

    What is clear by all this that the recent claims that Alex Van De Sande has nothing to do with the "White Hat Group" is an obviously lie. He was related, while there is no evidence he was active in the laundering or selling of the ETH tokens for the new version with Bity SA is not clear.

    But there is evidence from a leaked Ethereum Foundation skype chat that they were actively trying to manipulate the price of the old cryptocurrency to replace it with their own. In a non-profit channel, they are seen colluding control the price of the competing token. This competing token is the exact same token they worked with Bity SA and Slock.it GMBH to steal up millions of USD worth.

    Chat logs from leaked Ethereum Foundation chat log indicating they were colluding to control the price of competing cryptocurrency 
    Source: https://imgur.com/a/DHexx#4I1WrPY

    In the chat logs, Jeffrey Wilcke and Fabian Vogelsteller can both be discussing ways to use the resources of the non-profit Ethereum Foundation to control the price of assets they all own significant portions of. 

    This is not an isolated incident of Ethereum Foundation using their insider knowledge from operating the non-profit to make purchasing decisions. Vitalik Buterin of the Ethereum Foundation, shortly after the hack but before he announced there would be a hard fork announced he was buying DAO security/tokens on Twitter.

    Source: https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/741832934814949377

    Later it would come out with chat logs between the exchange operators after the event and even more later in pull requests from the Foundation that internal chats had decided the entire thing long before it was announced. So when Vitalik Buterin was buying DAO tokens, he had already known he would soft or hard, regardless of the stakeholders.

    In the creation, advertising, protectionism of the DAO security and taking leadership "curator" roles in the DAO there was a clear incestuous relationship between Slock.it, whos COO Stephan Tual previously worked at the Ethereum Foundation, and the members of the Ethereum Foundation.

    Source: http://ethereum.org

   They instead made all the decisions centrally, in internal chats, promoted security/assets that Ethereum Foundation members owned, built on Ethereum using their non-profit. 

    Despite all the evidence all over social media, the Swiss non-profit Ethereum Foundation now is denying any association, claiming it was just their members acting alone. But they acted alone in large groups, groups comprising of at least 25-75% of all Ethereum Foundation members, so the lines are obviously blurred. Their claims are refuted above and from a quote on Bity SA saying they did help, at least at one time. 

    "It is important to note that neither Slock.it, Alex van de Sande nor anyone else affiliated with the Ethereum Foundation had anything to do with what has taken place since well **before the Hard Fork**." (Emphasis on before the hard fork is mine)

    Fabian Vogelsteller of the Ethereum project is also named for being involved, as people report news they heard in the "White Hat Group" Slack channel:

    **Background**
    The Swiss non-profit Ethereum Foundation (Stiftung Ethereum, https://www.ethereum.org/foundation) founded to promote and develop decentralized and open technologies, including but not exclusively Ethereum. (Source: http://ethereum-classic-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/foundation.html)
    
    "The legal and financial complexities of raising funds through a presale led to the creation of several legal entities, including the Ethereum Foundation (Stiftung Ethereum) established June 2014 in Zug, Switzerland.
    
    Beginning in July 2014, Ethereum distributed the initial allocation of ether via a 42-day public ether presale, netting 31,591 bitcoins, worth $18,439,086 at that time, in exchange for about 60,102,216 ether. The results of the sale were initially used to pay back mounting legal debts and also for the months of developer effort that had yet to be compensated, and to finance the ongoing development of the Ethereum." (Source: http://ethereum-classic-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/history-of-ethereum.html)

    Neuchatel-based digital currency exchange Bity SA operators Alexis and Gian originally partnered with German UG to a GMBH, Slock.it to co-found DAO.Link according to Alexis Roussel (Source: http://www.coindesk.com/the-dao-just-raised-50-million-but-what-is-it/). They funded development, advised and actively premoted the digital contract which issued cryptocurrency securities. 

    After being informed by security researchers a bug in the contract had been found both Bity SA and Slock.it continued to promote the security until it raised 150,000 USD million dollars worth of cryptocurrency assets. (https://blog.slock.it/no-dao-funds-at-risk-following-the-ethereum-smart-contract-recursive-call-bug-discovery-29f482d348b#.4geeq3dny)

    After the exploit was reported and disregarded by the operators an anonymous entity used the exploit to steal 1/3rd of the cryptocurrency being held by the digital contract.
The contract they created can be found here: https://daohub.org/

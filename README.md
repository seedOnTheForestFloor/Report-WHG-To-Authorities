# Exercise our legal rights, call for a full investigation

**BOTH affected members of the community and others who are watching this massive financial crime happen, watching it actively hurting innocent people and tarnishing the reputation of all cryptocurrencies** request an official investigation from our legal systems.

### Who to report them to?
1. Switzerland Fedpol who handles corruption with non-profits
1. Switzerland Financial authorities that Bity SA is are registered with
2. Local authorities who will contact and work with Swiss authorities

**Switzerland will investigate**

Switzerland is in the middle of a policy shift regarding financial crimes, while it was once considered a safe haven for financial crime, they are now actively taking action to crack down and they actively cooperate with legal international investigations so it is worth reporting to local investigations too.

### Swiss Federal Office of Police
**Swiss Federal office of police** actively encourages people to report corruption. They have built a special hotline, corruption they want reported includes:

>"non-profit organisations (such as associations or foundations) in order to gain an unjustifiable material or immaterial advantage."

**Report to Swiss Federal Police** https://fedpol.integrityplatform.org/index.php?action=reportIncident&type=report

Evidence that Ethereum has been abusing their non-profit to protect DAO assets, using Ethereum resources to promote the DAO, ignoring their mission of decentralization when unilaterally deciding to hard-fork, using the knowledge they will hard fork to trade on insider knowledge and colluding to lower the market value of other cryptocurrencies.

###### Failing stated mission, then using insider knowledge from internal chats to trade
Despite operating a Swiss non-profit with money raised by the community for the "mission to promote and support research, development and education to bring decentralized protocols"

They instead made all the decisions centrally, in internal chats, promoted security/assets that Ethereum Foundation members owned, built on Ethereum using their non-profit.

###### Involvement in the "White Hat Group"/"Robin Hood Group" hack that were then sold to support a cryptocurrency they created and started supporting, which they had a history of doing as seen in the Skype chat

>"Bit more info: this isn't spur of the moment. A lot of people have worked around the clock for several days now to prepare for this. The community (individuals from the eth foundation, devs, security experts, ethcore, slock, etc) all came together to organize a response, which is currently ongoing."

Alex Van De Sande, or avsa on reddit and twitter, of the Swiss non-profit The Ethereum foundation is now denying any responsibility, or association, likely because of the legal fallout of recent events. But Alex was clearly involved with organizing the white hat group clearly was involved with organizing.
He was seen organizing on reddit.com/r/ethereum as seen in the screen shot below.
